    <h1>Mahatma Gandhi
    </h1>
    <p><mark>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (/ˈɡɑːndi, ˈɡændi/;[2] 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer,[3]
        anti-colonial nationalist,[4] and political ethicist[5] who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the
        successful campaign for India's independence from British rule[6] and in turn inspired movements for civil
        rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first
        applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.[7][8]

        Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, western India, Gandhi trained in law at the Inner Temple,
        London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was
        unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a
        lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised a family and
        first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India. He
        set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and
        discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for
        easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and above
        all for achieving swaraj or self-rule.[9]</mark></p>

        <h1>Mangal Pandey</h1>
        <p><mark>New Delhi: That a country of 130 crore people lives freely might not appear to be anything extraordinary to Generation Z, but when they turn to their history books they realise that only 73 years ago this was not the case. Freedom did not come easy to India. It came with the sacrifices of thousands of freedom fighters in 1947 on August 15. 

            However, while there was a raging desire to break free from the colonial rule, not many in early British India were able to rebel against White supremacy openly. 
            
            In such a scenario, it was one braveheart who dared to rebel against the British – Mangal Pandey, the man who is often referred to as the first freedom fighter of India. Mangal Pandey’s legacy is such that it was also exhibited on Hindi cinema by actor Aamir Khan in his 2005 feature film by the same name. 
            
            The 1857 war of Indian Independence 
            In the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, three regiments of the Indian Army refused to use the ammunition of the Enfield Rifles and demanded that Bahadur Shah Zafar take over the emperor of India as the head of the rebel. Mangal Pandey was one of the key figures of this rebellion who was among the first to attack the British regiment.  
            
            Mangal Pandey was born on July 19, 1827 in Nagwa village of one Ballia district (present Uttar Pradesh) to father Diwakar Pandey and mother Abha Rani. Since he was very young, Mangal had a good physique, seeing which an employee of the East India Company advised him to join the army. So, at the age of 22 in 1849, Mangal Pandey joined the 34th Bengal Native Infantry regiment of the East India Company. 
            
            The British Raj had caused widespread unrest and discontentment among the people of India. The Hindu soldiers protested against the addition of Gurkha, Sikh and lower caste soldiers to their ranks. The use of animal grease on the cartridges of the newly introduced Enfield rifles further escalated the discontentment.  
            
            On February 9, Mangal Pandey dared to refuse to use the cartridges with animal grease, causing the British to order his weapons and army uniform to be seized. On March 29, when Major Hewson proceeded to take away his rifle, Mangal killed him and escaped from there. 
            
            The British called its forces to capture Mangal Pandey, who knew he couldn’t be on the run for long. To avoid dying at the hands of the British, he shot himself. However, he survived the shot and unfortunately, was arrested by the British while injured. 
            
            On April 6, he was produced before a court that on April 18 sentenced him to death. But soon, many gathered in support of Mangal Pandey and a fearful British army hanged him to death 10 days in advance on April 8. 
            
            Mangal Pandey’s killing caused a rebellion across North India which gradually spread to the entire nation. The revolt of 1857 thus came to be known as the first war of Indian independence.   
            
            Soon after, 90,000 more men joined the mutiny. Although they suffered major losses in Kanpur and Lucknow, the British retracted to the Sikh and Gurkha forces and could ward off the rebel army near Delhi.  
            
            The 1857 Mutiny caused the British Parliament to pass an act to abolish the East India Company and India became a crown colony for the British to directly govern. Queen Victoria passed a policy of divide and rule, preventing the Indians to rebel against her. 
            
            However, Mangal Pandey ignited the spark that 90 years from the start of the Sepoy Mutiny gave India its independence.

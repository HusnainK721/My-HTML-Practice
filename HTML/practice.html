    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing <br>
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. <br>
      CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript</p>
    <hr>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
      This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
      presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
      separate </p>
    <hr>
    <p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than
      one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

      The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type)
      text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service
      for CSS documents</p>

    <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
      for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
      reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is
      accessed on a mobile device</p>

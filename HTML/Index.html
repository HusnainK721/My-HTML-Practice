        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <HR>
            <p> The HyperText Markup Language,<br> or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed 
            to be displayed <br>
             in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) <br>
             and scripting languages such as JavaScript. <br>

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and <br>
             render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure <br>
              of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. <br>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. <br>
                 With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <br>
                  HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics <br>
                   for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <br>
                    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>Tags such as (img) and (input) directly introduce content into the page. <br>
                     Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. <br>
                         Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, <br>
                             which affects the behavior and content of web pages. <br>
                              Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. <br>
                               The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards,<br>
                                has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

                                <p>HTML5 was published as a Working Draft by the W3C. <br>
                                    Although its syntax closely resembles that of SGML, <br>
                                     HTML5 has abandoned any attempt to be an SGML application and has explicitly defined its own "html" <br>
                                      serialization, in addition to an alternative XML-based XHTML5 serialization.</p>
